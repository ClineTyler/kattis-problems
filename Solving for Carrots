// import is a basic java method one can use for the most common method of reading in input from the keyboard 
// the "*" is like the wild card 
// it is like saying 
//import java.util.Scanner;
// The only diffrance is you do not need add more import methods from the util. 
// it kind of sums it all up as one 
// imports need to be before the class 

import java.util.*;

//This class is just Main it is holding the main lowercase m 
// static is a refrencen in where you can use it in any method without redeclaryying it. 
//Scanner is the name of a method where you can assign it a var that will allow you to take in new input
// you can only have one scanner and eventually you will learn that you need to close the scanner.
// System.in is the paramter(paramater)
// when calling any method you must make said method new because you are making a new attritubute to it or var.
